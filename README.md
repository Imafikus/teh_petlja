# IS PETNICA - TEH

Set of various programming tasks specifically designed for TEH course participants.

Each task has 3 levels, based on the programming skills you have, you can choose to do the task in 1 of them.

### Easy

These levels are intended for complete begginers. Every task has all it's functions written, you just need to call existing functions in the correct order inside the main(). 

### Medium

These levels are intended for people who have managed to write some custom functions.

Each level contains already written definitions and docstrings which describe in detail what each function needs to do. Your tasks is to fill out all the missing functions and to call those functions in the correct order inside the main.

### Hard

These levels are intended for people who are already familiar with python.

Each level contains only detailed requirements for the problem. Your task is to write code which complies with the requirements.

## Advices

Every task contains `solution.py` file which contains the working version of the task. 
You are free to run the code to see what's the expected behavior of the program.

You are **strongly encouraged** to try to solve the problem on your own, without looking at our solutions. If you get stuck on something somewhere,feel free to take a peek at `solution.py` but first **try on your own**.

If you feel that the task is too much for you, feel free to lower the difficulty.

Usage of Google, StackOverflow and Python Docs is strongly encouraged.

## Code style

We are using `snake_case` and w"""docstrings"""` **are mandatory**. Constant names are all `UPPERCASE`.
