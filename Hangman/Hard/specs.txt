Your task is to make a simple Hangman game.

In Hangman, the player has to guess the randomly selected word.
Player is guessing the word letter by letter.

Player has fixed number of lives. 

Player must be able to see number of lives he has left and number of letters he guessed so far.
For example: If we had a word 'aeroplane', and player had 5 lives at the beggining and his guessed letter
was 'a' he should be able to see that 'a _ _ _ _ _ a _ _' and he should see his number of lives.

Game runs until player guesses all the letters or until he loses all of his lives. If he lost you
must display the selected word for him

Words are kept in the words.txt file, you must choose one of them at random. There are some words added in
the starter file, but you are free to add more, if you want.

Another important thing is that words 'Tree', 'tree', 'TREE' and 'TrEe' all mean the same, so keep in mind
this information when you implement your code.

When starting to work on this task first try to make some key components of your program, then try to break
down those major components into small functions.

Majority of your main() function should be function calls. You are free to use whatever standard Python 3 library
you have (if you need it for some reason).
