Your task is to write a program which can solve an user input anagram.

User must input valid words (only letters and spaces allowed), if he doesn't ask for the input again.

You should display all the possible solutions for the given anagram.

If no solution exists you should display appropriate message.

Example: if user has input "A catnip trip" your program should output that solution is "participant"

You have file 'words.txt' which contains some words and file 'example_anagrams.txt' which contains some example anagrams
and their solution
