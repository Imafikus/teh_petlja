    Your task is to make a simple tick-tack-toe game for 2 players

    Welcome message should be displayed

    Program should ask players to input their names

    Players should be able to input coordinates, and they should be able to see situation of the board
    after each turn

    Program should detect who won, or if the game was a tie

    Results of the games must be stored in file named: first_player_name + second_player_name, extensions are optional

    Results files are stored in the folder results, and they must be in the following format:
    - Number of wins for the first player
    - Number of wins for the second player
    - Number of tied games

    When one game is finished, game statistic should be shown to the players in the following format:
        - Number of wins for the first player, win percentage of the first player
        - Number of wins for the second player, win percentage of the second player
        - Number of tied games, tie games percentage     
    
    After this players should be promped to enter if they want to continue playing, if they want, new game is started
    If the don't, godbye message appears and the program quits

    You may find 'os' library for python useful here.

    IMPORTANT: Program should be modular, and it shouldn't crash when unexpected
    things happen (such as incorrect input or missing files)
